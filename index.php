				<h2>Ibiza's Beaches</h2>
<a href="/en/islandmap.html"></a>
<p>Consult most guidebooks and there are about 25 beaches on the   White Isle. The Ibiza Tourist Board will tell you there are 50, but even they   admit there are others. </p>

<p><strong>Playa d'en   Bossa</strong> at the centre of its 2.5km ribbon of sand, the longest on the   island, famous for it&rsquo;s the all-day parties of <strong>Bora Bora</strong> but it's a family   favourite thanks to golden sands that shelve gently into clean seas. Every water   sport is available somewhere and although mobbed in high season, the crowds thin   out as you go towards the headland tower of Torre de se Sal Rossa. </p>
<p>One of the hippest <strong><a href="/en/beaches/index.html">Ibiza beaches</a></strong> is <strong>Las Salinas. </strong>Named after the Ses Salines salt plains behind it, Salinas pulls a clientele to match three of its chiringuitos (beach restaurants) - Monte Carlo high-fliers at Malibu, Euro Riviera hipsters at Jockey Club and beatnik models and dancers at chill paradise Sa Trinxa. Attracting a similar clubby crew but not so crowded is nudist and premier gay beach <strong>Es Cavallet, </strong>a less developed stretch around the headland from Salinas. </p>
<p>For more escapist holiday loafing head to: <strong>Cala Jondal </strong>near the wicked Jockey Club and funky Particular bar, <strong>Playa   S'Estanyol </strong>and <strong>Aiguas Blancas, </strong>another nudist beach often tipped as the alternative to the overcrowded   Salinas. Just as relaxed but with more of a family vibe are: </p>
<p><strong>Cala Mastella, </strong>a small notch in the East coast with two top restaurants; the red-cliffed cove of <strong>Sa Caleta, </strong>with its good restaurant and massage garden, and <strong>Cala Salada, </strong>another bay of red cliffs that feels far more remote than its 5kms north of San An. All of the beaches around Es Cubells are a good shout, too. </p>
<p><strong>Benirras </strong>is another of the White Isle's popular beaches. An isolated fjord-like   bay, it's a beach hangout of the Isle of Fun's neo&shy;hippies, who go bango on   their bongos at sunset. </p>
<p><strong>Punta Galera </strong>north of San Antonio attracts a   similar chilled clan to laze on the rocks and get into reiki and massage. Sound   boring? Then head to a touristy beach and watersports, holiday paradise: Playa d'en   Bossa, Cala Bassa, Playa de San Antonio, Cala Llonga, Playa de Santa Eulalia   near the river mouth, Playa des Figueral and Cala de Sant Vincent are your best   bets. For views, <strong>Cala d'Hort </strong>can't be beaten. </p>
<p><strong>Cala Conta</strong> up the coast is almost as   impressive, with its view over the island of Sa Conillera, reputedly the   birthplace of legendary Carthaginian general Hannibal. True wilderness beaches   exist even at the height of summer but you have travel for them. </p>
<p><strong>Cala d'en Serra</strong> is an untouched bay almost   enclosed by cliffs with a small scrap of sand and a snack shack, which is more   than <strong>Cala d' Aubarca </strong>on the north-west coast can boast but its   setting is awesome. Then there's <strong>Atlantis, </strong>the quarry for Dalt   Vila's walls and a famous beach of the first hippies; a Japanese tourist   'consecrated' the area by painting a Buddha next to its cave. The setting's   stunning, its waters are crystal and it's free of crowds, which is how locals   like it so they keep its location secret. But not a very good one - if you want   to find it you will.</p>
